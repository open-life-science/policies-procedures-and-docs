## Application Review Process

The OLS team will send assigned applications for you to review based on your preference and topic of interest as provided by you in the bid that matches your bio.
All the applications will be scored against a rubric integrated into the system.
Reviewing each application is likely to take 10-15 minutes, which should be submitted for each application that you have been assigned before the review submission deadline.
Please let the OLS team know if more time will be required, or if for any reason you are unable to review applications assigned to you within the given time frame.
Once registered on OpenReview, visit the Open Review page for the current cohort: https://openreview.net/group?id=openlifesci.org/Open_Life_Science/.
You should see all the applications assigned to you with the paper summary (title) as shown in the screenshot below for OLS-4.

## Application Allocation for Mentorship

We have already selected 1-4 most suitable applications for you to review, however, you would be able to request to review other applications.
Please see the 'review' related channel for a shared sheet where you can see the titles for all the applications.
Applications have been allocated to review based on what we think is compatible based on the common interests.
The review process should allow you to choose a project that you feel excited about and have some alignment with your ongoing work or past experience.
Of course, reviewing doesn’t mean you have to mentor the projects, you will be able to decline the project if you do not think you can mentor that.

## Adding your review

Click on the Submit Official Review button next to the application summary (title).
This will take you to the full proposal with details provided by the applicant.
Please read the full application - this should take 8-10 minutes in average.
Scroll down to choose your scoring (1, 2 or 3) under the New Official Review section.
We have provided rubrics in the drop-down menu (for instance, see the image below) describing what 1, 2, and 3 scores mean ‘readiness’, ‘goal’, ‘openness’, ‘willingness’, your ‘recommendation’ and preference for ‘mentoring’.
