## Cohort Call Wranglers

OLS members who have participated as a project lead in a previous cohort or have joined as an expert can volunteer to take the cohort call wrangler role in the ongoing cohort,
These individuals would like to learn more about the OLS processes or take a vital role in leading/facilitating the cohort calls.
They commit their time and leadership skills toward building a collaborative experience for the attendees of OLS cohort call.

We are very excited to create this role in OLS for the returning members from the previous cohorts of the OLS and eLife Innovation mentoring programs.

Our aim is to share our practices for training and planning so you can take them into your projects and community.
This is also an opportunity for us to invite community members to take on some of the management roles that are currently only carried out by the OLS team.

Our cohort calls vary in time from week to week: Please see schedules from our website here: https://openlifesci.org/

### Roles & Responsibilities
We invite you to take a lead on the following responsibilities for one or several cohort calls, depending on your availability and interests:

#### Before the call
Reviewing the cohort call notes (on Etherpad) for :

 - Typos and consistency (e.g. are all the headings formatted headings?)
 - Incorrect URLs
    - In many cases we copy the notes document from the last cohort, so always good to watch out for links to previous cohorts’ slides/resources. We don’t expect you to have the correct slide links though - please just let the team know on Slack about these in the facilitator's channel 
 - Information that should be shared with the cohort prior to the scheduled cohort call
**Time commitment:** 10-20 minutes per call

#### During the call
Co-hosting cohort calls by taking on a co-host role in Zoom: helping manage participants, keeping an eye on the chat, taking notes, chairing an expert talk, muting participants who may have by-mistake left the mic on causing background noise etc.

**Time commitment:** 90 minutes per call, please arrive 5-10 minutes early so we can assign co-host rights, you may join for a part of the call

#### After the call
Review notes, [otter.ai](http://otter.ai/) transcription and uploading cohort call video online

 - Follow the list of tasks on the cohort call processing issue, under “4. cohort call video preparation”. An example: https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/issues/283
 - Ask the organising team for credentials to [otter.ai](http://otter.ai/), YouTube and Zoom!

**Time commitment:** ~2 hours per call, latest by 9 pm UK Time on the Monday after the call (so that we can send the weekly cohort emails with the link to the recording!)

OLS team would like to offer an honorarium amount of $50 for each call you contribute to.
